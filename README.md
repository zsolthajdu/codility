# codility [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zsolthajdu/codility.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zsolthajdu/codility)
My solutions to some of the exercises on http://codility.com

To build the executables you'll need the CMake package.
* To create a Makefile, run 'cmake .'
* To create a Makefile for unoptimized debug build, with symbol information, run: cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
* Build executables on Linux : by running 'make' .
* On Windows Visual Studio Express can be used. CMake will create a compatible project.
